Good news.. :(

I am not 100% sure why, but after sending quickly a magic sequence of read attributes commands during the pairing process, now it works for me even when the battery was taken out for a long time,.

Please test and let me know if it works in your environments. Here I have tested it with two different C7 hubs (one is even on a non-standard Zigbee channel 24), but I have only one TS004F device. Seems there are critical timings that may vary in different setups.
