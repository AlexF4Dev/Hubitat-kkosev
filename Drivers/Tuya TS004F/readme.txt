Bad news.. :(

Switching between the Dimmer and Scene modes works, but... only when TS004F has been first paired to a Tuya gateway! Afterward, when the device is re-paired to HE hub, it can be switched into Scene control mode and all the 12 button combinations work.

However, if the battery cell is removed for several minutes and the device is paired to HE again, it will not work anymore.

The above means that we are still missing some specific configurations that are performed by the Tuya hub during the pairing process. I hope this missing configuration depends only on the Tuya Zigbee coordinator, and does not involve Tuya cloud in any way!

So, we don't have a working driver for TS004F yet. I will continue trying, but for sure this will take more time.
