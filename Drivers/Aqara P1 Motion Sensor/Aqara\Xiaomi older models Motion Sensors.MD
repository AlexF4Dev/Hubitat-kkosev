## Aqara/Xiaomi Motion Sensors

This is a new thread for the older models Aqara/Xiaomi motion sensors, that are supported by the "Aqara P1 Motion Sensor" driver.
There are already several Hubitat custom drivers that support these models. All these existing drivers are working very well, so probably there should be no reason to change them, except if you want to use one and the same driver for all different Aqara models, like I do : )
